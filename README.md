This project highlights the power of hyperparameter tuning in improving the performance of machine learning models like SVM. By optimizing the model's parameters, we can enhance its classification performance significantly.
SVM Implementation with Hyperparameter Tuning

This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using scikit-learn. It includes hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance, showcasing the basics of SVM and how different parameters impact the model.

Project Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm primarily used for classification tasks but can also be applied to regression problems. This project walks through the fundamental concepts of SVM and the process of improving its performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters.

Key Highlights:
Basic SVM Implementation: Introduction to SVM and how it can be used to classify data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Used two common tuning methods—Grid Search and Randomized Search—to find the best parameters for the model.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Technologies Used

Python: The programming language used for the implementation.
scikit-learn: The primary library for implementing SVM and hyperparameter tuning.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling.

* Steps Involved

* Dataset Preparation: Loaded and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
* SVM Model Training: Implemented a basic SVM model with default parameters.
* 
* Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search: Performed an exhaustive search over specified parameter values.
Randomized Search: Explored a random subset of hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the tuned model's performance using cross-validation and calculated metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
Hyperparameters Tuned:

Kernel: Linear, RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid
C: Regularization parameter
Gamma: Kernel coefficient
Degree: For polynomial kernel
Results

After tuning the hyperparameters, the model's performance significantly improved, and the best parameters were identified using both Grid Search and Randomized Search techniques.
